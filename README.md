# Clothes Segmentation Lab

Please see each experiment to read my results.

## Task Description

You are provided with a set of fashion images.  
Train should be divided into train and validation: You should choose your own technique.  
You need to add augmentations and normalization to the pipeline using any library you want.   
You need to train the segmentation model for 46 categories: Use PyTorch. 
Evaluate on the validation set. Use more than three metrics.  

The result of this homework should be a detailed technical report of the experiments with visualizations and conclusions. You should provide an explanation of each experiment you did, what changes you did, and why? how you dealt with the occurring problems.  
For each experiment, provide metric and loss visualizations (using TensorBoard or more preferable Wandb).
